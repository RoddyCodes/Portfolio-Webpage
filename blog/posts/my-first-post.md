My journey into software engineering wasn't a traditional one. My academic background is in Biology, a field I pursued with curiosity. However, through my studies, I discovered that what truly ignited my passion wasn't just observing complex systems, but building them.

### Finding the Parallel

At its core, biology is the study of life's intricate "code"—DNA. Understanding it requires logic, pattern recognition, and a systematic approach. I found that these same skills are the foundation of software development. The thrill of debugging a complex biological pathway felt surprisingly similar to debugging a tricky function.

### Why Tech?

I chose to pivot to tech, specifically full-stack development and AI, for three reasons:
1.  **Creation:** The ability to build a tangible, useful product from nothing but logic.
2.  **Scale:** Software allows a single person to create a solution that can impact thousands, or even millions, of people.
3.  **Learning:** The tech field is in a constant state of evolution, which guarantees a lifetime of learning—a prospect I find incredibly exciting.

This blog will be my space to document that learning journey. Thank you for joining me.
